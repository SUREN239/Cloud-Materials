
### 1. Create a Windows EC2 Instance and Connect Remotely

#### a. Launching the Instance:
1. **Login to AWS Management Console** and navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
2. Click **Launch Instance**.
3. Select a **Windows Server AMI** (Amazon Machine Image), e.g., Windows Server 2019 Base.
4. Choose **t2.micro** for the instance type.
5. Configure instance details as required, then click **Next** until you reach the **Configure Security Group** step.
6. Add a rule to allow RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) traffic on port 3389 from your IP address for security.
7. Review and launch the instance by selecting an existing key pair or creating a new one. **Download the key pair** if it’s new, as you’ll need this to decode the initial password.

#### b. Connecting to the Instance:
1. Once the instance is running, select it in the console.
2. Click on **Connect** at the top, and then go to the RDP client tab.
3. Download the remote desktop file and also get the password by using your key pair file.
4. Use a Remote Desktop client like Microsoft Remote Desktop to connect to the instance using the downloaded RDP file and obtained password.

### 2. Create and Attach an EBS Volume and Make a Partition

#### a. Creating and Attaching the EBS Volume:
1. In the EC2 Dashboard, go to the **Volumes** section under Elastic Block Store.
2. Click **Create Volume**, choose General Purpose SSD (gp2) or gp3, set the size to 5 GB, and create the volume.
3. Once created, select the volume and click on **Actions** > **Attach Volume**.
4. Select your Windows EC2 instance to attach it to.

#### b. Partitioning the EBS Volume:
1. On your Windows instance, open the Disk Management tool.
2. Initialize the new disk (if required) and create a new simple volume.
3. Format the new volume and assign a drive letter.

### 3. Create Files, Folders and Take a Snapshot

1. Create files and folders on the new EBS volume using File Explorer in Windows.
2. To take a snapshot, go back to the AWS Management Console, under **Elastic Block Store** > **Volumes**, select the volume.
3. Click on **Actions** > **Create Snapshot**, provide a description, and create it.

### 4. Create a Linux EC2 Instance and Connect Remotely

Repeat the above steps for creating an instance, but:
- Choose a Linux AMI like Amazon Linux 2.
- For remote access, you will use SSH instead of RDP. Use an SSH client like PuTTY or Terminal with the key pair.

### 5. Install HTTPD, Start, Enable Service, and Host a Static Website

1. Connect to your Linux instance using SSH.
2. Run `sudo yum update` and then `sudo yum install -y httpd`.
3. Start the httpd service with `sudo systemctl start httpd` and enable it on boot with `sudo systemctl enable httpd`.
4. Create a simple HTML file in `/var/www/html` (this is the default directory for Apache on Amazon Linux).
5. Test by accessing your instance's public IP or DNS name in a web browser.

### 6. Create an AMI and Launch a New Instance

1. Go to the EC2 console, select your instance.
2. In the Actions menu, choose Image and templates >Create image.
3. Enter the details for the AMI and create it.
4. Once the AMI is available, you can launch new instances from this AMI following the standard instance creation process.
